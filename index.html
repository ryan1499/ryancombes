    <h3>ME IN 10 SECONDS</h3>
    <p>I love learning, creating, and training. This means I spend my time doing things like coding, reading, writing, swimming,
        and thinking.<br><br>I'm currently on a gap year from Babson College and I own a social media advertising business based 
        out of Hawai`i, where I've grown up most my life.<br><br>
